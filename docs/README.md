## OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects using a customer-first, iterative approach with clear ownership and data-informed decisions. Key principles include:
- Delivering value in small, testable increments
- Assigning a Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead to each project
- Encouraging feedback and learning for psychological safety

### Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers:** Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs and approvals

### Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Project Lifecycle
1. **Initiation:** Problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning:** Scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution:** Build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release:** Deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective:** Capture learnings and next steps

### Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed
